      <description>Conversations with children can often be very illuminating, and often in both directions. I spent the past weekend with a 7-year old child, and the child&amp;rsquo;s 2-year old sibling. As a result we had many wonderful conversations about mathematics. The 7-year old (hence forth called J, and to simplify things, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;him/his&amp;rdquo; pronoun).
J knows and understands fairly well, the concept of addition and subtraction. He&amp;rsquo;s a little shaky on multiplication and is unsure about division.</description>
