So what's this all about then? Well, the idea of this website started off as a joke. The entire site, down to its subtitles and calls to action are puns on famous mathematicians who made real the idea of an algorithm, from [Emil Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Leon_Post), to [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), to [Kurt GÃ¶del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del). 

There is of course the second level of punnery. In OCaml, the string conversion functions between types have a pattern that looks something like this: `a_of_b`. Church_of_Turing seems to be a decent play on that. But of course, in explaining this joke, [the frog has been dissected](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/440683-explaining-a-joke-is-like-dissecting-a-frog-you-understand).

For now, the plan is to have a set of semi-regular blog Posts (har har, geddit?) on computation and what makes the notion of computation interesting. Along the way we may explore a bit on the fundamentals of mathematics, and even meta methematics (most people know this as Category Theory).

Mind, the Church of Turing isn't a Temple of Functional Programming, nor is it a Altar of Tape. We do not take sides. We compute. And one form of computation is as good as another.
