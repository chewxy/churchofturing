      <description>Conversations with children can often be very illuminating, and often in both directions. I spent the past weekend with a 7-year old child, and the child&amp;rsquo;s 2-year old sibling. As a result we had many wonderful conversations about mathematics. The 7-year old (hence forth called J, and to simplify things, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo;/&amp;ldquo;him/his&amp;rdquo; pronoun).
J knows and understands fairly well, the concept of addition and subtraction. He&amp;rsquo;s a little shaky on multiplication and is unsure about division.</description>

      <description>So what&amp;rsquo;s this all about then? Well, the idea of this website started off as a joke. The entire site, down to its subtitles and calls to action are puns on famous mathematicians who made real the idea of an algorithm, from Emil Post, to Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, to Kurt GÃ¶del.
There is of course the second level of punnery. In OCaml, the string conversion functions between types have a pattern that looks something like this: string_of_int.</description>
