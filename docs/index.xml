      <description>So what&amp;rsquo;s this all about then? Well, the idea of this website started off as a joke. The entire site, down to its subtitles and calls to action are puns on famous mathematicians who made real the idea of an algorithm, from Emil Post, to Alonzo Church and Alan Turing, to Kurt GÃ¶del.
There is of course the second level of punnery. In OCaml, the string conversion functions between types have a pattern that looks something like this: string_of_int.</description>
